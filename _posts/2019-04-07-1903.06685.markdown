We have recently made public a rather technical paper in which we
explicitly and unambiguously calculate the cosmic string loop number
density distribution in our universe coming from various motivated
loop production functions. Such a density distribution crucially
determines the spectrum of their emitted gravitational waves, a
smooking gun for their potential discovery.

Together with [**Pierre Auclair**](https://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/fr/auclair-pierre),
[**Mairi Sakellariadou**](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/physics/people/academicstaff/sakellariadou)
and [**Dani√®le Steer**](http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/fr/users/steer), we have
carefuly explored in Ref.{% cite auclair:2019zoz %} the consequences of
changing the slope of the Polchinski-Rocha loop production function to the actual
observable cosmic string loop distribution. This is the parameter
$$\chi$$ in the next plot:

For the cases we have referred to as "sub-critical", $$\chi < (3 \nu -
1)/2$$, corresponding to steep slopes in the previous figure, we
recover the results of Ref. {% cite lorenz:2010sm %}. The parameter
$$\nu$$ encodes the growing rate of the scale factor $$a(t)$$, namely,
we assume $$a(t) \propto t^\nu$$.

For shallower slopes, the so-called "critical" and "super-critical"
cases, $$\chi \ge (3\nu-1)/2$$, we find that either the loop
distribution incessantly grows, or, with some regularisation, reaches a
stationnary distribution whose shape depends on what happens on the
larger length scales. This is best illustrated by the following plot:

![diraccomp](/assets/images/1903.06685/diraccomp.png)

It compares the loop number density produced by assuming an infinitely
sharp loop production function peaked at $$\gamma = 0.1$$ (green
curve) with a (regularised) super-critical Polchinski-Rocha
distribution having $$\chi > 0.25$$ (purple curve), in the radiation
era ($$\nu=1/2$$). As this plot shows, the gravitational backreaction
scale, $$\gamma_\mathrm{c}$$, at which the loop production function is
cut **always matters** and is responsible for the plateau on the
purple curve at small $$\gamma$$ values. The existence of a second
plateau around $$\gamma \simeq 10^{-6}$$ comes from the Infra-Red
sensitivity of all super-critical loop production functions.
