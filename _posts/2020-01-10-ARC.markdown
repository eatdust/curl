We are pleased to open a  **post-doctoral position** in Gravitational
Wave Cosmology at CURL (Cosmology, Universe and Relativity at
Louvain), Louvain University (Belgium), starting fall 2021.

Applicants interested in stochastic gravitational wave background,
gravitational wave signatures of early universe physics, such as
cosmic strings, primordial black holes, cosmic inflation, as well as
data analysis for current and future gravitational wave
interferometers, such as Pulsar Timing Arrays, LIGO/Virgo and LISA,
are particularly encouraged to apply.

Appointment is available for two years.

The position is supported by a joint ARC research program in gravitational
wave physics between the [CP3 center](https://cp3.phys.ucl.ac.be) and
the [CURL group](https://curl.irmp.ucl.ac.be) at UCLouvain and the [STAR
institute](https://www.star.uliege.be) at Université de
Liège. Computing resources and support for travelling are excellent.

Letters of application (including a curriculum vitae, a list of
publications, a brief statement of research interests) and at least
two recommendation letters from senior scientists should be submitted
on-line, by the 10th of January 2021, at:
