A cosmic strings network present in our Universe should be incessantly
emitting gravitational waves. An absolute lower limit of the expected
signal can be found by determining the gravitational waves created
by the back bones of the network: the long cosmic
strings. [**Disrael**](/members/dacunha.html) and [**Christophe**](/members/chris.html), in collaboration with
[**Fran√ßois R. Bouchet**](http://www2.iap.fr/users/bouchet/bouchet.html), have
computed this irreducible contribution using new numerical
simulations of Nambu-Goto cosmic strings.

In Ref. {% cite dacunha:2022chf %}, we have run new simulations of
Nambu-Goto cosmic strings evolving during the radiation, the
transition, and the matter eras to compute the unequal time
correlators of the anisotropic stress tensor associated with the long
strings. The following figure shows a snapshot of one of this
simulation, the long strings have been represented in white whereas
all the other objects are loops, see Ref. {% cite ringeval:2017eww %}
and [this post]({% post_url 2019-04-07-1903.06685 %}).

This correlator is what sources the gravitational waves and it allows
us to solve for their creation, and propagation, all along the
Universe history. By using the Green's function method we can then
predict the strain, $$k^2 \mathcal{P}_h$$, and the energy density
parameter $$\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\mathrm{mat}}$$ of the gravitational
waves that can be measured today. Their power spectra are represented
below as a function of the wavenumber $$k$$.

In these figures, the exact numerical result is represented in black
while the blue and red curves show some semi-analytical approximations
that we had proposed in a previous paper, calibrated using the
amplitude found with the simulations, see Ref. {% cite dacunha:2021wyy
%}. The only significant deviations show up around $$k/\mathcal{H}_0
\simeq 100$$, which corresponds to the transition between the
radiation and matter era.

An interesting point to notice is that most of strain signal is
actually generated by the long cosmic strings in the matter era, i.e.,
close to us.

As we discuss in Ref. {% cite dacunha:2022chf %}, this signal is quite
small, but reachable by the
[**LISA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna)
satellites while satisfying the Cosmic Microwave Background
constraints.
