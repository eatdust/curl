### Induced superhorizon tensor perturbations from anisotropic non-Gaussianity


*While we have not detected large scale tensor perturbations, they are
essential for cosmology because we consider their origin is
microscopic quantum fluctuations during inflation. However, we should
note that the classical secondary effects of scalar perturbations also
source them after inflation. We usually consider that these secondary
effects are not significant on the CMB anisotropy scale, but we will
revisit this issue with non-Gaussian initial conditions for the scalar
perturbations. In this talk, we will show that induced tensor modes
can be generated on superhorizon scales through the intrinsic
long-short mode coupling due to the non-Gaussianity. The induced
tensor power spectrum has similar scale dependence with the primordial
contribution. Hence we can discuss the detectability by the CMB
anisotropy measurements. Interestingly, the induced tensor
perturbations can be significantly enhanced, depending on the
reheating scenario. Also, we will present the observational
consequences of various non-Gaussian initial conditions based on the
present framework.*
