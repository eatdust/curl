### Planck-Scale Physics and the Peccei-Quinn inflation model

*The radial direction of the Peccei-Quinn field can drive cosmic
inflation, given a non-minimal coupling to gravity. This scenario has
been considered to be capable of explaining inflation, the strong
CP problem, and dark matter. We argue that Peccei-Quinn inflation
is extremely sensitive to higher-dimensional operators. Further
combining with the discussion on the axion quality required to solve
the strong CP problem, we examine the validity of this scenario. We
also show that a resonant amplification of the axion field is
unavoidable after Peccei--Quinn inflation.*
