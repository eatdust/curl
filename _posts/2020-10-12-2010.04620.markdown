Vortons are centrifugally supported cosmic string loops that can be
continuously created at all times during the cosmological
expansion. Could they be all of the dark matter?

Together with [**Pierre
Auclair**](https://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/fr/auclair-pierre),
[**Patrick Peter**](http://www2.iap.fr/users/peter/) and [**Dani√®le
Steer**](http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/fr/users/steer), we have
calculated in Ref.{% cite auclair:2020wse %} their inclusive
cosmological distribution, taking into account the incessant
production of vortons from a scaling string network all along the
history of the Universe. They are a viable dark matter candidate!

This figure shows the density parameter of vortons today as a function
of the two fundamental parameters of the theory. They are the string
energy per unit length, $$G \mu$$, and the ratio of this energy scale
to the one at which a current condenses on the strings, $$ \mathcal{R}
$$. The green line represents values of the relic density
$$\Omega_\mathrm{tot} \in [0.2,0.4]$$, around the current abundance of
dark matter. For all possible values of $$G \mu$$, one can find a
current-carrier energy scale allowing for vortons to be all of the
dark matter.
