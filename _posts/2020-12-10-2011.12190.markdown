In a recent preprint, [**Cristian**](/members/joana.html) and
[**SÃ©bastien**](/members/clesse.html) show the robustness of
Starobinsky and Higgs inflation to inhomogeneous initial conditions of
all sizes. They have performed full numerical relativity simulations
with strong inhomogeneous initial field and velocities. After
some "wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey" evolution, the system relaxes
towards... **Cosmic Inflation**.


Their results are presented in Ref. {% cite joana:2020rxm
%}. Simulations show that sub-Hubble, as well as Hubble-sized, fluctuations
generically lead to inflation after an oscillatory phase between
gradient and kinetic energies. The following figure shows the
evolution of the equation of state for sub-Hubble (top), and
super-Hubble (bottom) inhomogeneous initial conditions.

Whilst Hubble-sized fluctuations are able to form large
pre-inflationary black holes, their horizons end up being always
sub-Hubble and this allows for inflation to take place in the
neighbourhood of the black hole horizon. These results could even
suggest that the formation of large pre-inflationary black holes can
[**catalize**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis) the onset of
inflation. They trap gradient energies and therefore smooth the field
and metric in the surrounding regions. An equatorial slice of a black
hole forming is represented below.

Paradoxically, when inhomogeneities escape the formation of black
holes, the dynamics becomes the richest. On sub-Hubble scales, the
non-linear dynamics of the deeply inhomogeneous scalar field sources
metric backreactions in the form of shear and tensor modes. These
modes are found to decay slower than the energy density of the field
and can potentially dominate the energy content of the Universe for a
while. However, when this occurs, the beginning of inflation is simply
delayed but never prevented. The next figure represents a snapshot of
the gravitational modes "energy" produced in the sub-Hubble dynamics.

Our analysis further supports the robustness of inflation to any size
of inhomogeneity, in the field, velocity or equation-of-state. At
large scalar field values, the pre-inflation dynamics only marginally
depends on the field potential and it is expected that such behaviour
is universal and it applies to any inflation potential of
plateau-type, as the ones favoured by the CMB observations after
Planck.
