In a recent preprint, [**Cristian**](/members/joana.html) and
[**SÃ©bastien**](/members/clesse.html) showed the robustness of
Starobinsky and Higgs inflation to inhomogeneous initial conditions of
all sizes. They have performed full numerical relativity simulations
having strong inhomogeneous initial field and velocities. After
some "wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey" evolution, the system relaxes
towards... **Cosmic Inflation**.


Their results are presented in Ref. {% cite joana:1832667
%}. Simulations show that Sub-Hubble and Hubble-sized fluctuations
generically lead to inflation after an oscillatory phase between
gradient and kinetic energies. The following figure shows the
evolution of the equation of state for super-Hubble (top), and
super-Hubble (bottom) inhomogeneous initial conditions.

Whilst Hubble-sized fluctuations are able to form large
pre-inflationary black holes, their horizons are always sub-Hubble
allowing inflation to take place in the neightbouring black hole
region. These results could even suggest that the formation of large
pre-inflationary black holes can indeed
[**catalize**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis) the onset of
inflation by trapping gradient energies and therefore smoothing the
field in the outside regions. An equatorial slice of a black hole
forming due to super-Hubble modes at Hubble crossing is represented
below.

Paradoxically, when inhomogeneities escape the formation of black
holes, the dynamics becomes the richest. On sub-Hubble scales, the
non-linear dynamics of the deeply inhomogeneous scalar field sources
metric backreactions in the form of shear and tensor modes. These
modes are found to decay slower than the energy density of the field
and can potentially dominate the energy content of the Universe for a
while. However, when this occurs, the beginning of inflation is
simplfy delayed but not prevented. The next figure shows the
gravitational modes produced in sub-Hubble dynamics.

Our analysis further supports the robustness of inflation to any size
of inhomogeneity, in the field, velocity or equation-of-state. At
large scalar field values, the pre-inflation dynamics only marginally
depends on the field potential and it is expected that such behaviour
is universal and it applies to any inflation potential of
plateau-type, as the ones favoured by the CMB observations after
Planck.
