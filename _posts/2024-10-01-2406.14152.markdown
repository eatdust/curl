Making observable predictions for cosmic inflation requires
determining when the wavenumbers of astrophysical interest today
exited the Hubble radius during the inflationary epoch. These instants
are commonly evaluated using the slow-roll approximation and measured
in e-folds time. [**Pierre**](/members/auclair),
[**Baptiste**](/members/blachier) and [**Christophe**](/members/chris)
propose a new analytical method to determine these instants with a
precision reaching the tenth of an e-fold.

Cosmic Inflation is the leading explanation for the origin of cosmic
structures: these are seeded by quantum fluctuations occurring around
the event horizon of a exponentially fast accelerating space-time, see
this [**post**]({% post_url 2022-09-15-2205.12608 %}). By measuring
the distribution of galaxies in our universe, the
[**Euclid**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_(spacecraft))
satellite is expected to provide very soon new exquisite measurements of these
fluctuations. Testing cosmic inflation will therefore require to have
exquisite predictions as well.

Observable predictions currently rely on the slow-roll approximation
to determine the so-called e-fold times $$\Delta N=Nâˆ’N_\mathrm{end}$$,
in reference to the e-fold $$N_\mathrm{end}$$ at which inflation
ended. These instants are actually used to map structures in the sky
to quantum fluctuations during inflation. The precision at which they
are determined is not so good, they are typically known at
$$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ e-fold precision. The following figure uses a full
numerical integration of various inflationary models to compute the
error made (vertical axis) using the slow-roll approximation as a
function of the exact timing (horizontal axis).

In Ref. {% cite auclair:2024udj %}, we propose a new and simple
**velocity correction**, on top of slow-roll, that increases by one
order of magnitude the precision on $$\Delta N$$. As
shown in the following figure, when compared to the exact solution,
our new method reaches an precision of about a tenth of e-fold (**blue
curve** compared to the red one).

The other curves (green and purple) show other corrections, improving
the determination of $$\phi_\mathrm{end}$$, the field value at which
inflation ends. These ones may, or may not, improve over the velocity
correction, depending on the model at hand.
