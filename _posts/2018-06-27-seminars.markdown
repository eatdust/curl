This Wednesday, we have not one but two cosmology seminars in a row!
We have the pleasure to receive **Mateo Martinelli** and **Alkistis Pourtsidou**.

At 13:00, Mateo Martinelli (Leiden U., Euclid), will be talking about


### Future constraints on parametrized modified gravity: the impact of	non linear scales and of theoretical priors


*In this talk I will present forecasted constraints on
Modified Gravity using Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing
measurements. I will explore different possible phenomenological
parametrizations for Modified Gravity models, encoding the effects of
these modifications in two generic functions (η and μ) of time and
space which affect the Poisson equation and the so-called
gravitational slip. I will focus on forecasts for future surveys and I
will highlight the constraining power gained when including non linear
scales in the analysis using phenomenological prescription for the
modelling of these scales in the Modified Gravity framework.  I will
then discuss how it is possible to connect phenomenological
parameterizations to viable theories of modified gravity, imposing
theoretical conditions on the reconstructed functions.*

After a coffee break, at 14:30, Alkistis Pourtsidou (Queen Mary U.,
SKA, Euclid) will talk about

### Cosmology with neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping

*I will introduce the innovative technique of HI intensity
mapping, which allows for precise cosmological measurements in the
radio wavelength. After talking about the current status of intensity
mapping measurements, I will focus on forthcoming surveys using
instruments like MeerKAT/SKA and CHIME to probe dark energy as well as
galaxy evolution. I will also present synergies between optical galaxy
and radio intensity mapping surveys in order to probe dark energy and
gravity, mitigate systematic effects, calibrate photometric redshifts,
and measure primordial non-gaussianity.*
