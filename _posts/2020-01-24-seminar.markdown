At 14:00, room E349, Disrael Camargo Neves da Cunha (CURL, Louvain U.), will be talking about


### Signatures of Cosmic Strings on the Dark Matter Distribution


*In the first part of the talk, I will present a brief review of
cosmic strings and some of its observational consequences. One of the
observable object produced by a cosmic string is the wake, which is a
high-density sheet-like structure in the matter distribution. The
second part will be a description of the work
[**arXiv:1508.02317**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02317) in which the
stability of the wake is analyzed. The principal conclusion is that
this object could be globally undisrupted until today. Finally, I will
mention the consequences of this work for wake presence and possible
detection in the large scale structures, using the results from N-body
simulation of dark matter distribution with a wake:
[**arXiv:1804.00083**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00083),
[**arXiv:1810.07737**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07737)*
