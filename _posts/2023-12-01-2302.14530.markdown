Could cosmological perturbations stretched over distances larger than
the size of the observable Universe modify the shape of our
space-time? [**Baptiste**](/members/blachier.html),
[**Pierre**](/members/auclair.html)
and [**Christophe**](/members/chris.html), in collaboration with
[**Vincent Vennin**](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/vincent-vennin/?lang=en), have
recently shown that this is the case through the spatial curvature.


It is a common Cosmologist's intuition that cosmological fluctuations,
the tiny perturbations of amplitude $$10^{-5}$$ at the origin of
galaxies, should induce some kind of noise on the cosmological
parameters. Is this quantifiable? Are super-Hubble cosmological
perturbations having an effect at all?

In Ref. {% cite blachier:2023ooc %}, we show that arbitrarily long
perturbations have an observable effect. More precisely, the gradient
and Laplacian of these fluctuations are dynamically **creating a
spatial curvature** in the homogeneous and isotropic metric of local
observers. In the following picture, we sketch how one of these modes,
having a wavelength much larger than the observer's Hubble radius, can
be "felt" through its gradient.

It is not a few Hubble-sized fluctuations that contribute, but an infinite
number of super-Hubble modes, all those having wavelength larger than our observable
universe. Denoting by $$K$$ the curvature of the FLRW spatial sections,
and $$\xi$$ the sum of these constant modes, we find

$$ K = -\frac{2}{3} \Delta \xi - \frac{1}{3} \left(\nabla \xi \right)^2. $$

However, because fluctuations are, by definition, of random nature, we
cannot predict a definite value for the curvature density parameter
$$\Omega_\mathrm{K_0}$$. This one is now promoted to a stochastic
variable. Even though the sum of all super-Hubble modes averages to
zero, i.e. $$\langle \xi \rangle = 0$$, we predict, for the standard
Gaussian and scale-invariant cosmological perturbations, a very small
non-vanishing value

$$ \langle \Omega_\mathrm{K_0} \rangle = -\frac{\langle K e^{-2\xi} \rangle}{a_0^2 H_0^2} = \frac{5}{6} \mathcal{P}_* \simeq 1.7 \times 10^{-9}. $$

More importantly, because $$\Omega_\mathrm{K_0}$$ is a stochastic
variable, it also fluctuates and its realizations are, in fact,
dictated by its standard deviation

$$ \sqrt{\langle{\Omega_\mathrm{K_0}^2}\rangle-\langle{\Omega_\mathrm{K_0}}\rangle^2} \simeq \dfrac{1}{3}
\sqrt{\mathcal{P}_*} \simeq 1.5 \times 10^{-5}.$$

This is the **typical value** that any observer will measure **at any
epoch** during the cosmic history.

But there is more. The spatial curvature of our local Hubble patch is
thus a measurable number that can tell us what is going on on the
largest possible length scales of the Universe, length scales that are
much larger than our Hubble volume. What if the infinite sum of very
large wavelength modes, $$\xi$$ here, is no longer a small
quantity? Such a situation could very well be happening if the
Universe has experienced a period of stochastic inflation in its
infancy!

In Ref. {% cite blachier:2023ooc %}, we have been able to estimate the
full probability distribution function for $$\Omega_\mathrm{K_0}$$
when cosmological fluctuations are generated by Cosmic Inflation. If
$$\xi$$ remains small, it is a slightly distorted Gaussian
distribution with a typical width of $$10^{-5}$$, as expected. But if
inflation last for a long period, enough for $$\xi$$ to be of order
unity, the distribution becomes highly non-Gaussian, as represented in
the following figure (red curve)

In this plot, the black curve is what would be a Gaussian probability
distribution with same width. Clearly, large values of
$$\Omega_\mathrm{K_0}$$ are now much more probable than what one could
have naively expected. Are we going to measure a non-vanishing
$$\Omega_\mathrm{K_0}$$ in the future?
