In a recent preprint, we discuss the possibility that both the Planck
mass and the dark energy scale are dynamically generated by stochastic
effects during inflation.

Two of the energy scales involved in gravitation, the Planck mass
$$M_\mathrm{Pl} \simeq 10^{18}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$ and the cosmological
constant energy scale $$\rho_{\Lambda}^{1/4} \simeq 10^{-3}\,
\mathrm{eV}$$ differ by many orders of magnitude.

Together with [**Teruaki Suyama**](/members/suyama.html) and [**Masahide
Yamaguchi**](http://www.th.phys.titech.ac.jp/cosmo/) from
[**TiTech**](http://www.th.phys.titech.ac.jp) (Tokyo), we explore in
Ref.{% cite ringeval:2019bob %} the possibility that both have been
dynamically generated from a new and unique ultra light scalar field
that would have experienced super-Hubble quantum fluctuations during
primordial inflation.

The scenario is currently passing all cosmological and astrophysical
constraints, and could be proven at work with future gravitational
wave measurements of the non-minimal coupling.
