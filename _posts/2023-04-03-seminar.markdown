At 2pm, room E349, Daniele Steer (APC), will be talking about

### Cosmology and distance measurements with gravitational wave observations

*In this talk I will outline the main different methods on the market
 for measuring cosmological parameters (including modified gravity
 parameters) with GWs, and the main sources of errors in these
 measurements. Then I will highlight the current results on
 cosmological parameters obtained with the O3 run of LIGO-Virgo, as
 well as give predictions for future expectations. Finally I will go
 into more technical details and explain an analytical approach to
 estimate distance errors with GW observations (from any number of
 ground based interferometers placed at different positions on
 earth).*
