The two recent gravitational-wave events GW190425 and GW190814 from
the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo have both a companion which is
unexpected if originated from a neutron star or a stellar black
hole. [**Sébastien**](/members/clesse.html) and [**Juan
García-Bellido**](https://uam.academia.edu/JuanGarciaBellido)
investigate the possibility that these objects are Primordial Black
Holes (PBHs) in Ref. {% cite clesse:2020ghq %}.

The known thermal history of the Universe predicts that the PBH
formation is boosted at the time of the QCD transition, inducing a
peak in their distribution at this particular mass scale, and a bump
around 30−50 $$M_\odot$$. We find that the merging rates inferred from GW190425
and GW190814 are consistent with PBH binaries formed by capture in
dense halos. At the same time, the rate of black hole mergers around
30 $$M_\odot$$ and of sub-solar PBH mergers do not exceed the LIGO/Virgo
limits. Such PBHs could explain a significant fraction, or even the
totality of the Dark Matter, but they must be sufficiently strongly
clustered in order to be consistent with current astrophysical limits.

This figure shows the expected merging rate distribution for
primordial black holes, as a function of the two component masses and
for tidal capture in dense haloes.  The green and orange lines
indicate the rates inferred from the GW190425 and GW190814 events
(dashed: best fit, solid: $$90\%$$ confidence limits), in agreement with
the primordial black hole predictions.
