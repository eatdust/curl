We are happy to announce the opening of a **post-doctoral position**
in Gravitational Wave Cosmology at CURL (Cosmology, Universe and
Relativity at Louvain), Louvain University (Belgium), starting fall
2020.

Applicants with expertises in gravitational wave signatures of early
universe physics, stochastic gravitational wave background, cosmic
defects, primordial black holes, cosmic inflation, as well as data
analysis for current and future gravitational wave interferometers,
such as LIGO/Virgo and LISA, are particularly encouraged to apply.

Appointment is available for two years, and could possibly be extended
to 3 years depending on mutual satisfaction and available funding.

The position is supported by a joint ARC research program in gravitational
wave physics between the [CP3 center](https://cp3.phys.ucl.ac.be) and
the [CURL group](https://curl.irmp.ucl.ac.be) at UCLouvain and the [STAR
institute](https://www.star.uliege.be) at Université de
Liège. Computing resources and support for travelling are excellent.

Letters of application (including a curriculum vitae, a list of
publications, a brief statement of research interests) and at least
two recommendation letters from senior scientists should be submitted
on-line, by the 15th of January 2020, at:
