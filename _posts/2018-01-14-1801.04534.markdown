In our public preprint {% cite penna-lima:2018mxk %} we discuss how we
can use the energy conditions to constrain a wide range of Extended
Theories of Gravity (ETG).

We know observationally that at least at the local tests (e.g., solar
system scale), general relativity describes extraordinarily well the
gravitation dynamics, moreover at these scales all energy conditions
are fulfilled. Thus, it is reasonable to impose the energy conditions
to the energy momentum tensor that describes the ordinary matter
components. From this assumption we derive a new condition on this
class of ETGs. Armed with this new condition we can impose different bounds on the
ETG effective energy density, pressure and equation of state using
observational data. For example, with a further assumption that the
effective energy density of the ETG is strictly positive we get the
following bounds in the figure below:

This figure shows the upper and lower bounds on $$w^\mathrm{ETG}$$,
the ETG's effective equation of state. The four panels show how these
bounds depend on the value of the ETG's energy density. We expect
future observations (Supernovae Ia, Baryon Oscillations, cosmic
chronometers, etc) will be able to pinpoint which characteristics a
viable ETG must have.
