The final 2018 release of the Planck satellite measurements have been
published today on the ESA website and the arXiv. They currently provide the
strongest constraints on the Big-Bang model, and much more!

All papers are there: [**Planck 2018 results**](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2018)

The first paper on the [**legacy of
Planck**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06205) provides a nice overview
of what Planck has been achieving since its launch in 2009!
