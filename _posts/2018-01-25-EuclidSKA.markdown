We have recently released a preprint {% cite sprenger:2018tdb %}
in which we have computed cosmological forecasts for the Euclid space telescope and the SKA radiotelescope.

In particular, we have devised a new method to model the theoretical
error that goes beyond the usual cut-off on small scales. The
advantage of this more efficient implementation of the non-linear
uncertainties has been tested through a Markov--Chain--Monte--Carlo
(MCMC) forecast of the sensitivity of Euclid and SKA to the standard
Î›CDM model and three extended scenarios.

We have compared the sensitivity of 14 different combinations of
cosmological probes and experimental configurations.  Interestingly,
we found a significant improvement of the constraints on the extended
model parameters when combining Euclid with a low redshift HI
intensity mapping survey by SKA1, demonstrating the importance of the
synergy of Euclid and SKA.

This is so far the most exhaustive forecasting work based on Bayesian
methods, both for Euclid and the SKA: it has required to run more than
150 MCMC simulations, for a total of several hundred thousands of CPU
hours.
