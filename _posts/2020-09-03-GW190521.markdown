The gravitational waves emitted during the merging of two black holes
of 85 and 66 times the sun mass have been detected on May 25, 2019 by
the LIGO detectors in the United States and the Virgo detector in
Italy.

The existence of so massive black holes is quite unexpected because
theoretical models disfavour the formation of black holes between
65 $$M_{\odot}$$ and 120 $$M_{\odot}$$ when the most massive stars explode in
supernovae. They may come from previous mergers, but, then, they should
live in a dense black hole environment, like a black hole or star
cluster, in order to have a chance to form a binary.  An exotic
alternative: these black holes could be primordial and have formed
less than a milli-second after the Big-Bang, from pre-existing
inhomogeneities in the primeval plasma.  This scenario could explain
some intriguing properties of black hole mergers detected so far.  An
idea proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971 that comes back at the
forefront of hot topics in Science.

CURL members SÃ©bastien Clesse and Christophe Ringeval are members of
the Virgo collaboration, working on the gravitational waves from
cosmic strings, and from primordial black holes. Upcoming LIGO/Virgo
observations will help to distinguish the different models of black
hole formation[^1]. See Ref. {% cite clesse:2020ghq %} and [this
