### Cosmology with the cosmic web: the high resolution promise

*The large scale structure of the Universe, the cosmic web, is a key
probe for late-time cosmology, and is indeed targeted by several of
the major observational efforts in the coming decades. However, its
analysis is hampered by the complex non-linear dynamics it undergoes
as structure grow. A lot of efforts has focused on the impact of
non-linearity on the observables, in particular the power
spectrum. However, the non-linearity also affects error bars, and thus
the information content, by generating non-Gaussian tails that induce
new covariance term. After sufficient introduction, I will present a
first exhaustive derivation of the covariance of the galaxy angular
power spectrum. The impact will then be presented for a baseline
cosmological analysis up to mildly non-linear scale, showing
decreasing returns. By contrast, I will finally show that there is a
large motivation to jump more boldly and push into the strongly
non-linear regime at high resolution.*
