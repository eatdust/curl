### Primordial black holes and stochastic inflation

*Quantum fluctuations from cosmic inflation give rise to the
 macroscopic structures of the universe. The strongest fluctuations
 collapse into primordial black holes, a dark matter candidate and a
 possible source of gravitational waves. Stochastic inflation is a
 tool to compute the fluctuation statistics non-perturbatively, needed
 for accurate black hole predictions. I discuss recent progress in
 these computations, their numerical implementation and analytical
 approximations, and the implications for black hole abundance in
 single-field models of inflation.*
