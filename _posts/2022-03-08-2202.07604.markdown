Traditionally the problem of initial conditions for inflation has been
treated separately from studies of reheating. To allow for a
parametric-type reheating, the inflaton must be allowed to interact
with (or decay to) other fields, and, these interactions should be
present also during inhomogeneous preinflation. Could they prevent
cosmic inflation to start in the first place?  In a single-author
publication [**Cristian**](/members/joana.html) answers this question
for Higgs Inflation: once more, inflation always starts and passes the
challenge!


The inflationary paradigm postulates an early phase of accelerated
expansion of the Universe. Such a period provides an explanation for
the observed large-scale homogeneity and flatness in the cosmos.
After the end of inflation, the universe would have gone through a
phase where the energy of the inflaton is transferred to Standard
Model particles, heating up the universe and leading to a bath of
ultra-relativistic particles behaving like radiation.  This phase is
known as reheating.

Traditionally the problem of initial condition for inflation, i.e.,
knowing if inflation can start from highly inhomogeneous initial
conditions, has been treated separately from studies of
reheating. However, they are connected. To allow for the so-called
parametric-type reheating, through resonances occurring while the
system is oscillating at the bottom of the potential, the inflaton
must be microscopically coupled to other fields. So, again, one could
raise the question: shouldn't these interactions be present also
during inhomogeneous preinflation? Do they prevent cosmic inflation
to start?

In a previous paper, see Ref. {% cite joana:2020rxm %}, we have
studied the robustness of *single-field* Higgs Inflation to
inhomogeneous initial conditions of all sizes. We have paid attention
to include the gravitational dynamics of the system, showing the possible
formation of pre-inflationary black holes, as well as the generation
of shear/tensor modes in the metric. In short, we have showed that
these gravitational dynamics can only delay the beginning of inflation, but
never prevent it.

In Ref. {% cite joana:2022uwc %}, [**Cristian**](/members/joana.html)
expands the previous settings by adding an extra field into the Higgs
Inflation model. This field is coupled such that it allows for a
reheating of the Universe. Reheating is actually successful for a
range of the field-field interaction strength, which is numerically
explored in full General Relativity simulations. Then the same model
is confronted to various preinflationary inhomogeneous settings and the
full gravitational and scalar-field dynamics are investigated.

The figure below shows the preheating resonances for the auxiliary
field (left panel). Structure formation occurs $$2$$-$$3$$ e-folds
after the end of inflation (right panel).

Looking at the exact same model during the inhomogeneous multi-field
preinflationary epochs, we confirm that the Higgs non-minimal coupling
to gravity acts as a stabilizer as it *washes out* the energy
contribution of the other minimally coupled matter/scalar-field
sectors. In Ref {% cite joana:2022uwc %}, it is shown that this occurs
naturally when one canonically normalizes the fields in the Einstein
frame. This effect generalizes the dynamics of inhomogeneous
extra-matter components, making them sub-dominant in comparison to the
inflaton.

The above figure illustrates the gravitational and scalar-field
dynamics during pre-inflation. Two simulations are shown, one with
super-Hubble initial conditions (left) and another with sub-Hubble
size inhomogeneities (right).

All in all, these investigations further confirm the robustness of
Higgs Inflation to multi-field inhomogeneous initial conditions, while
putting in evidence the formation of complex structures during the
reheating. The possible production of compact objects during the
reheating, such as primordial black holes, will be investigated in
future works.
