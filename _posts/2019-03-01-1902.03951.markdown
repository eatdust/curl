The final release of the Planck data 2018, see [this
post]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-07-18-Planck2018 %}), invited
us to finalize a long project in which we discuss the *actual* status of
[**Cosmic Inflation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) with
respect to what we have learned about the early universe.

In a quite long preprint {% cite chowdhury:2019otk %}, we are trying to
exhaustively address all the criticisms raised against the inflationary
paradigm and confront them to what the Planck data told
us. The conclusion is short and summarized in the abstract:

>Although we find that important questions still remain open, we
>conclude that the inflationary paradigm is not in trouble but, on the
>contrary, has rather been strengthened by the Planck data.
