Primordial black holes could not only explain the dark matter, but
also the origin of the ordinary matter in the
Universe. [**Sébastien**](/members/clesse.html), [**Bernard
Carr**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Carr) and [**Juan
García-Bellido**](https://uam.academia.edu/JuanGarciaBellido) propose
a new baryogenesis scenario in Refs.{% cite garcia-bellido:2019vlf %}
and {% cite carr:2019hud %}.

When density fluctuations collapse gravitationally in the early
Universe to form primordial black holes, all the conditions are met to
produce the observed baryon asymmetry around the collapsing
regions. Moreover, this scenario naturally explains why the Dark
Matter and Baryons have similar densities. No parameter tuning is
required if these density fluctuations are due to the stochastic
quantum fluctuations of a light spectator field during inflation.

The above figure is a qualitative representation of the three steps
in our scenario:

* (A) Gravitational collapse to a PBH of the curvature fluctuation at
horizon re-entry.

* (B) Sphaleron transition in hot spot around the PBH, producing
baryons locally through electroweak baryogenesis.

* (C) Propagation of baryons to rest of Universe through jets,
  resulting in the observed Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe.
