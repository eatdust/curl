### Cosmology from the anisotropic power spectrum with Euclid


*Euclid will be the first experiment to observe redshift space
distortions from space. This way it will be able to survey the sky,
not limited by distortions in the Earth’s atmosphere. The design of
the survey and the instrument will enable us to reach 1% precision in
the power spectrum. This will give us the power to conduct
unprecedented tests of Einstein’s gravity and the expansion history of
the universe. However this will also mean that we must reach an
unprecedented understanding of our systematic effects, whether coming
from our instrument or the foreground sky. It will also mean we will
need to ensure our theories are adequate to be tested against such
precise data. In this talk I will describe Euclid - our instrument,
our survey, and our science. I will describe the challenges in
understanding it’s systematics and I will present some results from my
resent work on testing two competing models for non-linear large scale
structure.*
