We have released a new version of [**Encyclopædia
Inflationaris**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3787) and its associated
public code
[**ASPIC**](https://github.com/cosmicinflation/aspic). This opiparous
edition extends the original paper by 400 pages and features 46 new
models of inflation that have been proposed in the last decade. Cosmic
Inflation is ready to tackle the data challenges of tomorrow.

The first edition of **Encyclopædia Inflationaris** was published in
Ref. {% cite martin:2014vha %} and authored by [**Jérôme
Martin**](https://inspirehep.net/authors/998637),
[**Christophe**](/members/chris.html) and [**Vincent
Vennin**](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/vincent-vennin/?lang=en). It
was built upon the slow-roll models of inflation proposed prior to
2013, the year of the first
[**Planck**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)) data
release. It contains accurate reheating-consistent slow-roll
calculations of the background universe and of the expected scalar and
tensor perturbations for all these models. Although it is now often
seen as a review, it is a genuine paper as it goes beyond the mere
gathering of known results. Indeed, a fair fraction of these models
had been studied only under rough approximations, which were not
matching the accuracy needed by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
data. The ambition of the project was, and still is, to provide an
(almost) exact treatment of single-field inflationary models using
only the slow-roll approximation while incorporating the kinematic
effects of reheating.

All these results are also incorporated in a public runtime library,
**ASPIC** {% cite aspic %}, which has been used in a number of
subsequent works. For instance, Bayesian model comparison using the
Planck CMB data has been presented in Refs. {% cite martin:2013nzq %}
and {% cite martin:2014rqa %} while the constraints derived on the
reheating epoch have been separately presented in Refs. {% cite
martin:2014nya %} and {% cite martin:2016oyk %}.

Ten years later Cosmic Inflation remains the most favoured scenario
of the early universe {% cite chowdhury:2019otk %} but several
developments have called for the release of a new edition:

+ First, at the theoretical level, new models have been proposed. Some
  of them boil down to one of the functional forms of the inflationary
  potentials already encoded in ASPIC, in which case they have been
  added in the relevant sections[^1]. Some other models give rise to
  new inflationary potentials, and therefore constitute new sections
  of Encyclopædia Inflationaris, as well as new entries in the ASPIC
  library. There are 24 such new potential functions in the new
  edition (here ordered alphabetically): **Axion Hilltop Inflation**
  (AHI), **Cubicly Corrected Starobinsky Inflation** (CCSI),**Double
  Exponential Inflation** (DEI), **Dual Inflation** (DI), **Fibre
  Inflation** (FI), **Generalized Double Well Inflation** (GDWI),
  **Hyperbolic Inflation** (HBI), **Hybrid Natural Inflation** (HNI),
  **Non-Renormalizable Corrected Loop Inflation** (NCLI),
  **N-Formalism Inflation** (NFI), **Non-Minimal Large Field
  Inflation** (NMLFI), **Pure Arctan Inflation** (PAI), **Radiatively
  Corrected Inflection Point Inflation** (RCIPI), **Radiatively
  Corrected Large Field Inflation** (RCLFI), **String Axion Inflation
  I** (SAII), **String Axion Inflation II (SAIII), Super-conformal
  Alpha Attractor A Inflation** (SAAI), **T-Model Inflation** (TMI),
  **Super-conformal Alpha Attractor B Inflation** (SABI),
  **Super-conformal Alpha Attractor T Inflation** (SATI), **Symmetry
  Breaking Kähler Inflation** (SBKI), **S-Dual Inflation** (SDI),
  **Smeared Higgs Inflation** (SHI), **Mukhanov Inflation**
  (VFMI). The inclusion of these models allows the new edition to
  provide an up-to-date landscape of all single-field slow-roll
  inflationary models, bringing the number of models included in the
  **ASPIC** library to 118.

+ Second, at the observational level, the first edition compared the
  predictions of single-field models with the early release of the
  Planck 2013 data. Since then, additional data has been collected,
  and the second edition features second-order slow-roll constraints
  from the full [**Planck Legacy +
  Bicep-Keck**](https://pla.esac.esa.int) data combination. The
  Bayesian evidence of all models has also been re-computed with the
  new data set, and the results will be presented in a separate
  publication.

+ Third, as the accuracy of the recent data releases has kept
  improving, several projects are on their way that should deliver
  even more accurate cosmological data in the years to come. In
  particular, let us mention ground-based experiments that are
  currently operating such as [**BICEP3 & Keck
  array**](http://bicepkeck.org/) and
  [**SPT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole_Telescope) in
  Antarctica,
  [**QUIJOTE**](https://research.iac.es/proyecto/quijote/pages/en/home.php)
  in the Canary islands, and
  [**CLASS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology_Large_Angular_Scale_Surveyor),
  [**ACT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Cosmology_Telescope)
  and [**Polarbear**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POLARBEAR) in the
  Atacama desert. They have been very recently joined by
  [**QUBIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubic_experiment). In
  space, the
  [**Euclid**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_(spacecraft))
  satellite is soon to be launched and will provide unprecedented
  measurements on the matter power spectrum, down to very small
  scales. The [**LiteBIRD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiteBIRD)
  satellite is planned to be launched in 2028 and should allow us to
  further constrain the $$B$$-mode signal in the polarisation of the
  CMB. These prospects of ever increasing precision confirm the
  relevance of the original Encyclopædia Inflationaris and ASPIC
  projects, namely the need for accurate predictions on a
  model-to-model basis. For this reason, we have continued to pay
  special attention to solve the inflationary dynamics exactly,
  without any other approximations than those contained in the
  slow-roll framework. This one has indeed been shown to be
  sufficiently accurate for the Planck CMB data {% cite
  ringeval:2013lea %} and can be extended to arbitrary precision if
  needed {% cite auclair:2022yxs %}. On the contrary, as discussed in
  Ref. {% cite martin:2016iqo %} other commonly-employed
  approximations are now too imprecise to allow for a fair comparison
  with the data.

Some of the new models are compatible with the present data, as one
could have expected, but this statement is **strongly** reheating
dependent. This can be illustrated by the following figure. It shows
their predictions, namely spectral index $$n_\mathrm{S}$$ and
tensor-to-scalar ratio $$r$$ as a function of the reheating energy
scale $$E_{\mathrm{reh}}$$ (assuming a matter-like reheating for
illustration purposes). The contours are the $$68\%$$ and $$95\%$$
confidence intervals associated with the successive Planck data
releases since 2013.

As this figure shows, getting reheating-consistent predictions has
never been so crucial. The reheating expansion history determines the
part of the inflationary potential being probed by cosmological
measurements, it can now substantially affect the preference shown by
the data for a given model (in technical terms, the Bayesian
evidence). This is one of the reasons why, in the opirarous edition,
the **Starobinsky model** (SI) and **Higgs Inflation** (HI) are now
treated as distinct models, since they come with different reheating
histories. Moreover, even though they are often treated as sharing the
same potential, this is only correct at leading order in an expansion
with respect to the inverse of the non-minimal coupling of the
field. Differences arise at next-to-leading order that we now account
for in an exact manner.

The previous figure certainly confirms the strategy adopted since the
early days of Encyclopædia Inflationaris to derive
reheating-consistent predictions. Ignoring it can indeed be
catastrophic. As an example, here are the reheating-consistent
predictions of one of the new model proposed *after* the Planck data
release. Not including reheating effects would imply selecting random
points in this mess...

Let us note that in its new edition, the format of the paper has been
purposely kept similar to its original version. In particular, the
introduction (section 2) has been essentially left untouched in order
to keep track of our original motivations, and of the main
considerations that were discussed in the field at that time. We have
also not completed section 3 with a list of new analytical results
derived in the 46 new potentials, given that we think it has already
become clear that Encyclopædia Inflationaris is more than a review
indeed. At the time of this post, the opiparous edition is made public
only through [**arXiv:1303.3787v4**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3787) with a full open access [**CC BY-NC-SA
4.0**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

Finally, about the benefit of a second edition, let us quote [**Jean
Le Rond
d'Alembert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%27Alembert)
(in a letter to
[**Voltaire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire), June 23,
1766):
>
> Quant à l'ouvrage, il est maigre, mais il est aisé de lui donner de l'embonpoint dans une seconde édition.

[^1]: These models may nonetheless come with different values for the parameters describing the potential, i.e. different priors in the framework of a Bayesian analysis.
