We have released a new version of [**Encyclopædia
Inflationaris**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3787) and its associated
public code
[**ASPIC**](https://github.com/cosmicinflation/aspic). This opiparous
edition extends the original paper by 400 pages and features 46 new
models of inflation that have been proposed in the last decade. Cosmic
Inflation is now ready to tackle the next data challenges.
