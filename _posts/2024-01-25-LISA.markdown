On this historic day, the European Space Agency
([**ESA**](https://www.esa.int)) gave
[**approval**](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Capturing_the_ripples_of_spacetime_LISA_gets_go-ahead)
to
[**LISA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna),
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. This decision marks a
significant milestone for the LISA mission as it signifies the
acceptance of its design and scientific goals.

LISA will be the next-generation observatory in the field of
gravitational waves, surpassing current terrestrial capabilities by
exploring lower frequencies and longer timescales, opening up a new
observation window into the universe.  and technological
innovation. The LISA definition study report, which [**Pierre**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07571) was a
part of, presents an in-depth analysis of the mission's scientific
rationale, design, and implementation plans. It highlights the
groundbreaking discoveries that LISA is expected to make

With ESA's approval, the LISA mission moves one step closer to
reality!
