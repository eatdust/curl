On this historic day, the European Space Agency
([**ESA**](https://www.esa.int)) gave
[**approval**](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Capturing_the_ripples_of_spacetime_LISA_gets_go-ahead)
to
[**LISA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna),
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. This decision marks a
significant milestone for the LISA mission as it signifies the
acceptance of its design and scientific goals.

LISA will be the next-generation observatory in the field of
gravitational waves, surpassing current terrestrial capabilities by
exploring lower frequencies and longer timescales, opening up a new
observation window into the universe.  and technological
innovation. The LISA definition study report, in which [**Pierre**](/members/auclair) was a
contributor, presents an in-depth analysis of the mission's scientific
rationale, design, and implementation plans, see Ref. {% cite
colpi:2024xhw %}. It highlights the
groundbreaking discoveries that LISA is expected to make
