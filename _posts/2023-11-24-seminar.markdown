### Synergies between gravitational waves and CMB spectral distortions

*In this talk, I will discuss various ways in which distortions to the
 frequency spectrum of the cosmic microwave background can be used to
 place constraints on stochastic backgrounds of gravitational
 waves. After a brief overview of spectral distortion theory, I will
 show how enhancements to the small-scale primordial power spectrum of
 curvature perturbations can induce sizeable distortions. Even in the
 absence of enhancements, a nearly-scale invariant spectrum presents a
 target well within reach of next generation
 experiments. Additionally, I will highlight how the presence of
 primordial tensor modes will also lead to an inevitable (although
 small) distortion signature. I will then apply this formalism to a
 model of scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), showcasing how
 constraints on the primordial scalar power spectrum can be mapped to
 the gravitational wave parameter space for these models. Time
 permitting, I will also show our updated formalism can be used to
 improve constraints on the parameter space of primordial black
 holes.*
