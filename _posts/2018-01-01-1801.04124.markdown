We have recently made public a preprint {% cite boucher:2018xvk %}
about a very specialized work in which we have tested the feasibility
to use small telescopes to make optical follow-up of Planck cluster
candidates detected by the
[**Sunyaev-Zel'dovich**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyaev%E2%80%93Zel%27dovich_effect)
effect.

The above picture shows the redshift distribution obtained over a
hundred objects, most probably galaxies, detected within $$3'$$ from
the center of an unconfirmed Planck's SZ candidate.

In summary, with a 0.6 meter telescope, photometric redshift
measurements are possible in a redshift range of $$z_{\mathrm{phot}}
\simeq 0.1$$ up to $$z_{\mathrm{phot}} \gtrsim 0.6$$. This opens-up
the possiblity for amateur astronomers to collectively contribute to
SZ candidate validation with basic observables such as
$$z_\mathrm{phot}$$ and galaxy counts.
