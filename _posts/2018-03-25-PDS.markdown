From March 19th to 25th, SÃ©bastien took part to the [**Printemps des
Sciences**](https://uclouvain.be/fr/decouvrir/scinfuse/printemps-des-sciences.html)
event, an entire week dedicated to science outreach for children and
youths in Belgium.  Two activities were proposed.

In *Alice et le Big-Bang*, about two hundreds children from 6 to 10
discovered the secrets of cells, atoms, stars, galaxies and the
Universe, back to the Big-Bang.  This activity obtained the best mark
in the evaluations provided by accompagnying teachers.

The second activity took the form of a public lecture dedicated to
secondary school students, on Black Holes, the Big-Bang and the
Universe.
