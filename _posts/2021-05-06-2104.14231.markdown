Some cosmological sources of gravitational waves, such as cosmic
strings, are everywhere present and incessantly emitting. Their past
and present contribution can mix together to create some fine structure in
the stochastic gravitational wave background today.

[**Disrael**](/members/dacunha.html) and
[**Christophe**](/members/chris.html) have calculated in Ref.{% cite
dacunha:2021wyy %} the all-length scales unequal-time strain power
spectrum $$\mathcal{P}_h$$ and the energy density parameter
$$\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}$$ of gravitational waves generated by
various scaling sources. For extinct and smooth enough sources, they find that both quantities
have an oscillatory fine structure, represented as black dotted curve in the following
figures.

On top of that, singular and never extinct sources, such as cosmic
strings, can create interferences and their spectra exhibit a
different fine structure. They are represented as red curves in the
figures. For instance, long cosmic strings in the matter era are
expected to have a rescaled strain spectrum $$k^2
\mathcal{P}_h^{\mathrm{mat}}$$ oscillating around a scale invariant
plateau (blue curve above), which is quite different from the one
associated with extinct and smooth sources. It also deviates
significantly from $$\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\mathrm{mat}}$$.

Will the fine structure of the stochastic gravitational wave
background be measured?
