Together with a collaborator from UAM-IFT (Madrid), Juan
Garcia-Bellido, we have recently published an article in the French
science outreach magazine *Pour la Science*, entitled *Matière noire:
la piste des trous noirs*.  This article is available
[**here**](https://www.pourlascience.fr/sd/cosmologie/matiere-noire-la-piste-des-trous-noirs-10075.php).

American*, see

In this article, {% cite garcia-bellido:2017nmv %}  we review and explain the recent observations
pointing towards the possilbe existence of massive primordial black
holes, born less than one milli-second after the Big-Bang.  Such
primordial black holes could explain the origin of the Dark Matter in
the Universe and provide the seeds of the super-massive black holes at
the center of galaxies.  Finding a firm observational evidence for
even a single primordial black hole would revolutionize our
understanding of the early Universe, and might help to resolve
long-standing problems of cosmology and astrophysics.
