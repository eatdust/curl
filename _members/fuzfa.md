My research interests include theoretical cosmology (dark energy,
cosmic structure and primordial black holes formation), numerical
relativity, electromagnetic detection of high-frequency gravitational
waves. My favourite "hobby horse" is to revisit controversial topics
such as gravity control or interstellar travel, and to publish
scientifically rigorous papers on these.

My teaching duties at UNamur include astronomy, differential geometry,
mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, general relativity and
cosmology.
