I am a cosmologist mostly interested with the physics of the very
early Universe mainly through the prism of gravitational wave
detectors.  My specialities range from the study of topological
defects to the aftermath of a first order phase transition and the
formation of Primordial Black Holes; but I am always keen to discover
new things.

I have been involved in gravitational wave experiments, both
ground-based (Virgo) and space-bound (LISA).
