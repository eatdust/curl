I work on searches for physics beyond the standard model. Given that a
large class of models describing physics beyond the standard model
predicts the appearance of topological defects, I study the
consequences of these phenomena in the large scale structure (LSS) of
the universe. My work involves performing numerical computations that
simulate these effects to find optimal statistics that extract the
signal from the topological defects. The primary goal of this study is
to favor or discard classes of models that extend the standard
model. I used various numerical computational tools, such as N-Body
simulation (CUBEP3M, Gadget, PKDGRAV3, and PICOLA) and data analysis
(Curvelab, S2let).
