I am working on theoretical Cosmology, with a focus on understanding
how large-scale cosmological structures arose from quantum
fluctuations in the primordial universe. By doing so, the hope is to
learn more about the physical conditions that prevailed in the early
universe, and to test physics at energy scales that are much larger
than what can be probed in particle-physics experiments, questioning
both the foundations of quantum mechanics and the nature of gravity.
