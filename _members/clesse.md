My fields of interest include cosmic inflation (hybrid models,
forecasts for future CMB missions), primordial black holes (formation,
gravitational-waves, dark matter, astrophysical and cosmological
signatures), Bayesian methods in cosmology (development of MontePython
likelihoods for Euclid, SKA, COrE), modified gravity (signatures in
large-scale structures, 21cm signal, solar system and laboratory
experiments).  I am involved in several international experiments,
such as Euclid, the SKA, LISA and LIGO/Virgo.
