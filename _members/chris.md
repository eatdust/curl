My research interests range from the understanding of the early
universe, the place and time at which the candidate unified theories
of Nature may have been at work, to data analysis and model testing
with cosmological observables. They are motivated by both theoretical
results and observational discoveries.

I have been involved in the Planck data analysis of
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) while my current interests are
in CMB polarization measurements, large scale structures (Euclid
satellite), gravitational waves (LISA satellites) and forecasts for
future 21cm surveys.
