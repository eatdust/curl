My research interests range from the understanding of the early
universe, the place and time at which the candidate unified theories
of Nature may have been at work, to data analysis and model testing
with cosmological observables. My researches are for one part driven
by theoretical results and modern observational discoveries, and for
the other part by simply having fun!

I have been involved in the Planck data analysis of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) while my current interests revolve around
CMB polarization measurements, large scale structures (Euclid
satellite), gravitational waves (LISA satellites) and forecasts for
future 21cm surveys, plus a handful of other fun projects.
