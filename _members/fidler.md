I am interested in the dynamics of the Universe, both at early times
related to the CMB and at late times for the large scale structure.

SONG
: I am involved in the development of the non-linear Boltzmann code
  SONG. This code simulates the early Universe at unrivalled precision
  including all standard model species.
: Currently it is used to compute:
  - B mode polarisation of the CMB induced from non-linear dynamics after inflation
  - Non-Guassianity in the temperature and polarisation of the CMB from non-linear dynamics
  - Spectral Distortions in the CMB from reionisation
: Working on this project I have gained valuable experience in
numerical simulations and programming. I also have a good
understanding of numerical mathematics and have designed several new
methods fit for the computations performed by SONG.

Theoretical Cosmology
: I am working on the theoretical framework related to non-linear simulations.
: My work contributes to developing the framework of second-order
cosmological perturbation theory. I have derived the polarised
non-linear Boltzmann equations.
: I am working on a new formalism for non-linear propagation of photons in curved spaces.
