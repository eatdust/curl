<p><em>The radial direction of the Peccei-Quinn field can drive cosmic

been considered to be capable of explaining inflation, the strong

is extremely sensitive to higher-dimensional operators. Further
combining with the discussion on the axion quality required to solve
the strong CP problem, we examine the validity of this scenario. We
also show that a resonant amplification of the axion field is
unavoidable after Peccei–Quinn inflation.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next cosmology seminar takes place on Friday 2nd of December, seminar room E349 at 2pm.

<p>Random Apollonian Packing (RAP) is inspired by the better-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket">Apollonian
Gasket</a>. In
mathematics, an Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by starting
with a triple of circles, each tangent to the other two, and
successively filling in more circles, each tangent to another three.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2211.07509/gasket.svg" alt="gasket" title="Apollonian Gasket started from three equidistant cercles" /></p>

<p>In Ref. <a class="citation" href="#2022arxiv221107509a">[1]</a>, Pierre examines a
related mechanism in which \(d\)-dimensional spheres are randomly
seeded in space, one at a time, within a finite-sized volume, and
with the largest possible radius that avoids overlap.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2211.07509/packing-full.svg" alt="packing" title="One realization of a Random Apollonian Packing with the first 1000 spheres" /></p>

<p>The interest of the RAP mechanism is that it is thought to share
universal properties with more general dynamic mechanisms, such as the
ABK mechanism (named after Andrienko, Brilliantov and Krapivsky) in
which bubbles grow linearly with time.</p>

<p>Pierre has built a model to explain at which rate Random Apollonian Packings grow after the
insertion of one sphere after the other. The model’s prediction for
the fractal properties of RAP are consistent with numerical
simulations made in two, three and four dimensions.</p>

<p><em>Primordial black hole (PBH) is one of the most promising cold dark
 matter candidates in recent years. The signature of PBHs in the
 stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) is natural as PBH
 formation requires a significant amplification in inflationary scalar
 curvature perturbation, which sources the tensor perturbation in
 second order and amplifies the SGWB. We explore this possibility to
 probe different possible reheating histories. We find that any change
 in reheating histories can shift the PBH mass range and the peak
 frequency of SGWB. Still, only the matter-dominated reheating phase
 can lead to an additional resonant amplification in SGWB at a very
 high frequency.
 Isocurvature perturbation from PBH distributions
 contributes to the adiabatic perturbation. It also leads to
 detectable amplification in the induced GW background and can
 contribute to Baryogenesis for ultra-low mass PBHs, which can
 dominate the universe for a small duration. Combining these two
 effects can help us probe primordial black hole scenarios and details
 of reheating histories, leaving diverse implications for cosmology
 and particle physics.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next cosmology seminar takes place on Friday 30th of September, seminar room E349 at 2pm.

implies that all forms of matter and radiation observed today are the
outcome of quantum fluctuations occurring around the event horizon of a
exponentially fast accelerating space-time. Clearing the ground for
the incoming spatial and ground based cosmological observations,
<a href="/members/auclair.html"><strong>Pierre</strong></a> and
<a href="/members/chris.html"><strong>Christophe</strong></a> have derived, at an
unprecedented level of precision, the shape of the expected power
spectra of both the quantum-generated gravitational waves and

<p>Cosmic Inflation is an hypothetical early phase of accelerated
expansion that has occurred before the first billionth of a second of
existence of our Universe. It provides a natural mechanism to explain
the observed flatness of our Universe today and naturally solves the
so-called horizon problems of the Big-Bang model.</p>

<p>In a spectacular way, the quantum fluctuations that are inherently
sourced during the inflationary era are exactly what is needed to
explain the origin of the cosmological perturbations: the <strong>seeds of the
galaxies</strong> of today.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2205.12608/ngc83.jpg" alt="ngc83" title="Galaxy Group NGC80" /></p>

<p>These quantum fluctuations are deeply rooted in gravity and appear as
both primordial gravitational waves \(h_{ij}\) and curvature
perturbations \(\zeta\), with very peculiar correlation functions. In
Ref. <a class="citation" href="#auclair:2022yxs">[1]</a>, we have pushed to third order the
calculation of these correlation functions. They are completely
determined by the Hubble parameter during inflation \(H(N)\) and its
logarithmic derivatives, \(\epsilon_i(N) \equiv \mathrm{d}\ln H /
\mathrm{d} \ln N\) (the so-called Hubble flow functions). Here \(N=\ln a\)
is the logarithm of the scale factor \(a\).</p>

<p>Slow-roll inflation <strong>predicts</strong> the correlation functions to be
given by these spectra:</p>

<p><em>Cosmic inflation is an hypothetic phase of accelerated expansion of
the Universe, a tiny fraction of second after the Big-Bang, induced by
the existence of a scalar field in the early Universe and suspected to
be at the origin of the present structures of the Universe. During
inflation, in about \(10^{-35}\) second, the distance between any two
points in the Universe separated by one meter becomes larger than the
distance to the farthest galaxies. This makes inflation one of the
most fascinating phenomena in Science.</em></p>

<p><em>This picture shows the results of more than 4 millions numerical
simulations of inflation in a model with two scalar fields, called
hybrid inflation, for which inflation stops due a broken symmetry,
similar to the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. The \(x\) and \(y\) axis
represent the initial value of each scalar field, a white dot indicate
that the simulation led to enough expansion for being compatible with
our Universe, whereas for black dots, there is no, or not enough,
inflation.</em></p>

<p><em>Before these results were obtained in Ref. <a class="citation" href="#clesse:2009ur">[1]</a>,
at ULB and UCLouvain, it was thought that only the thin vertical white
band could lead to inflation, suggesting a fine-tuning problem. This
picture shows that, on the contrary, a large number of initial
conditions are satisfactory and form a complex fractal structure. In
analogy with anamorphosis, a phenomena consisting in the distortion of
an image through an optical instrument, one can see this fractal
structure as the image of the thin vertical band seen through the
potential associated with the scalar fields, playing the role of the
optical instrument.</em></p>

<p>In Ref. <a class="citation" href="#dacunha:2022chf">[1]</a>, we have run new simulations of
Nambu-Goto cosmic strings evolving during the radiation, the
transition, and the matter eras to compute the unequal time
correlators of the anisotropic stress tensor associated with the long
strings. The following figure shows a snapshot of one of these
simulation, the long strings have been represented in white whereas
all the other objects are loops, see Ref. <a class="citation" href="#ringeval:2017eww">[2]</a>
and <a href="/news/2019/04/07/1903.06685.html">this post</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2205.04349/snapshot_h063.png" alt="nbsimu" /></p>

<p>This correlator sources the gravitational waves and it allows us to
solve for their creation, and propagation, all along the Universe
history. By using the Green’s function method we can then predict the
strain, \(k^2 \mathcal{P}_h\), and the energy density parameter
\(\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\mathrm{mat}}\) of the gravitational waves
that can be measured today. Their power spectra are represented below
as a function of the wavenumber \(k\).</p>

<p>In these figures, the exact numerical result is represented in black
while the blue and red curves show some semi-analytical approximations
that we had proposed in a previous paper, calibrated using the
amplitude found with the simulations, see Ref. <a class="citation" href="#dacunha:2021wyy">[3]</a>. The only significant deviations show up around \(k/\mathcal{H}_0
\simeq 100\), which corresponds to the transition between the
radiation and matter era. An interesting point to notice is that most
of strain signal is actually generated by the long cosmic strings in
the matter era, i.e., close to us.</p>

undergone different phase transitions. In particular, first order
cosmological phase transitions provide a compelling source of
Gravitational Waves (GWs) and this is particularly interesting in the
context of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna"><strong>LISA</strong></a>. In
a recent publication, <a href="/members/auclair.html"><strong>Pierre</strong></a> and his
collaborators proposed a new accurate semi-analytical model for
predicting the GW signal generated by a turbulent phase in the
aftermath of a first order phase transition.</p>

<p>LISA can potentially detect GW signals from first order phase transitions occurring
in the energy range \(100\,\mathrm{GeV}\) – \(1 \,
\mathrm{TeV}\). There are several processes possibly leading to
sizeable emission of GWs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bubble percolation, with the consequent breaking of spherical symmetry, is the most direct one</li>
  <li>Bubble collision</li>
  <li>Sound waves produced in the fluid by expanding bubbles</li>
  <li>Decaying turbulence in the fluid</li>
</ul>

<p>In Ref. <a class="citation" href="#auclair:2022jod">[1]</a>, we propose a new model to the decay and
decorrelation of a purely vortical velocity field and calculate the
subsequent GW signal. To confirm the accuracy and relevance of the
model, we have carried out a campaign of massively parallel direct
numerical simulations of decaying turbulence. The figure below shows
a slice across one of these simulations.</p>

<p>The following figure shows the initial conditions for the velocity
field in real space
<img src="/assets/images/2205.02588/V_0000.png" alt="V0" /></p>

<p>After some evolution, the velocity field decays and small scale
structures develop. The next figure shows the velocity field
after \(20\)

turnover times
<img src="/assets/images/2205.02588/V_0001.png" alt="V1" /></p>

<p>Based on this modelling, we provide an approximate analytical form for
the GW signal which could be readily used within the LISA
collaboration to search for it. In the figure below, coloured lines
show the results of the simulations, the black line the
semi-analytical model and the grey line the analytical form usable for
LISA.</p>

<p>Other new findings are presented in Ref. <a class="citation" href="#auclair:2022jod">[1]</a>. For instance, including an initial growth phase for the turbulent
flow is shown to heavily influences the spectral shape of the
SGWB. This highlights the importance of a complete understanding of
the turbulence generation mechanism.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As our Universe has expanded and cooled, it is suspected that it has undergone different phase transitions.

<h3 id="linear-perturbations-of-black-holes-in-dhost-gravity">Linear perturbations of black holes in DHOST gravity</h3>

<p><em>General relativity can be tested at many scales using various
 physical systems. A particularly interesting probe is the study of
 the ringdown phase of a binary black hole merger, during which the
 gravitational waves emitted by the newly-formed black hole are well
 described by perturbation theory over a single black hole
 background. The features of these waves depend heavily on the theory
 of gravity underlying the solution and the solution
 itself. Therefore, they can be used both to test GR and rule out some
 black hole solutions. We focus in this talk on the study of new
 behaviours for these waves in scalar-tensor theories in the
 Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) class. In such
 theories, the usual dichotomy between axial (odd parity) and polar
 (even parity) perturbations no longer enables one to decouple all
 degrees of freedom since the even parity sector contains one
 additional scalar degree of freedom. Axial perturbations can still be
 completely decoupled: we show that they propagate in an effective
 metric that differs from the background metric, and is not always a
 black hole metric. In the case of polar perturbations, we present a
 systematic approach that extracts the asymptotic behaviour of
 perturbations at spatial infinity and near the horizon directly from
 the perturbed Einstein’s equations. This asymptotic behavior gives
 physical insight about the modes, such as their direction and speed
 of propagation, and allows us to rule out some solutions that
 explicit bad behavior. Furthermore, we can use the obtained
 asymptotic behavior to numerically solve the propagation equations
 and compute quasinormal modes in systems where this was not possible
 before.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next cosmology seminar takes place on Thursday 19th of May, seminar room E349 at 11am.

<h3 id="cosmology-with-the-cosmic-web-the-high-resolution-promise">Cosmology with the cosmic web: the high resolution promise</h3>

<p><em>The large scale structure of the Universe, the cosmic web, is a key
probe for late-time cosmology, and is indeed targeted by several of
the major observational efforts in the coming decades. However, its
analysis is hampered by the complex non-linear dynamics it undergoes
as structure grow. A lot of efforts has focused on the impact of
non-linearity on the observables, in particular the power
spectrum. However, the non-linearity also affects error bars, and thus
the information content, by generating non-Gaussian tails that induce
new covariance term. After sufficient introduction, I will present a
first exhaustive derivation of the covariance of the galaxy angular
power spectrum. The impact will then be presented for a baseline
cosmological analysis up to mildly non-linear scale, showing
decreasing returns. By contrast, I will finally show that there is a
large motivation to jump more boldly and push into the strongly
non-linear regime at high resolution.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next cosmology seminar takes place on Thursday 7th of April, seminar room E349 at 11am.
