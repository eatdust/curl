of 85 and 66 times the sun mass have been detected on May 25, 2019 by
the LIGO detectors in the United States and the Virgo detector in
Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/outreach/ligovirgo_merger.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GW190521&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of so massive black holes is quite unexpected because
theoretical models disfavour the formation of black holes between
65 \(M_{\odot}\) and 120 \(M_{\odot}\) when the most massive stars explode in
supernovae. They may come from previous mergers, but, then, they should
live in a dense black hole environment, like a black hole or star
cluster, in order to have a chance to form a binary.  An exotic
alternative: these black holes could be primordial and have formed
less than a milli-second after the Big-Bang, from pre-existing
inhomogeneities in the primeval plasma.  This scenario could explain
some intriguing properties of black hole mergers detected so far.  An
idea proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971 that comes back at the
forefront of hot topics in Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURL members Sébastien Clesse and Christophe Ringeval are members of
the Virgo collaboration, working on the gravitational waves from
cosmic strings, and from primordial black holes. Upcoming LIGO/Virgo
observations will help to distinguish the different models of black
hole formation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The known thermal history of the Universe predicts that the PBH
formation is boosted at the time of the QCD transition, inducing a
peak in their distribution at this particular mass scale, and a bump
around 30−50 \(M_\odot\). We find that the merging rates inferred from GW190425
and GW190814 are consistent with PBH binaries formed by capture in
dense halos. At the same time, the rate of black hole mergers around
30 \(M_\odot\) and of sub-solar PBH mergers do not exceed the LIGO/Virgo
limits. Such PBHs could explain a significant fraction, or even the
totality of the Dark Matter, but they must be sufficiently strongly
clustered in order to be consistent with current astrophysical limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the first part of the talk, I will present a brief review of
cosmic strings and some of its observational consequences. One of the
observable object produced by a cosmic string is the wake, which is a
high-density sheet-like structure in the matter distribution. The

stability of the wake is analyzed. The principal conclusion is that
this object could be globally undisrupted until today. Finally, I will

&lt;h3 id=&quot;induced-superhorizon-tensor-perturbations-from-anisotropic-non-gaussianity&quot;&gt;Induced superhorizon tensor perturbations from anisotropic non-Gaussianity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While we have not detected large scale tensor perturbations, they are
essential for cosmology because we consider their origin is
microscopic quantum fluctuations during inflation. However, we should
note that the classical secondary effects of scalar perturbations also
source them after inflation. We usually consider that these secondary
effects are not significant on the CMB anisotropy scale, but we will
revisit this issue with non-Gaussian initial conditions for the scalar
perturbations. In this talk, we will show that induced tensor modes
can be generated on superhorizon scales through the intrinsic
long-short mode coupling due to the non-Gaussianity. The induced
tensor power spectrum has similar scale dependence with the primordial
contribution. Hence we can discuss the detectability by the CMB
anisotropy measurements. Interestingly, the induced tensor
perturbations can be significantly enhanced, depending on the
reheating scenario. Also, we will present the observational
consequences of various non-Gaussian initial conditions based on the
present framework.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">Our next cosmology seminar takes place on Friday 29th of November, seminar room E349 at 2pm.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flrw-cosmology-as-a-conformally-invariant-field-theory-in-1d&quot;&gt;FLRW cosmology as a conformally invariant field theory in 1D&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the last decades, conformal field theory (CFT) technics have
played an important role in black hole physics, due to the discovery
of unexpected conformal symmetries in the near horizon of black
hole. Using these technics, crucial features of black hole physics,
among which their spectroscopy, quasi-normal modes, as well as their
state counting have been reproduced using CFT technics.  So far, the
possible existence of similar hidden conformal symmetry in
cosmological spacetimes have been much less investigated.  In this
talk, I will show that the simplest cosmological model, consisting in
the homogeneous and isotropic Einstein-Scalar system, enjoys a
surprising hidden conformal symmetry. I will present in detail this
new structure, the associated Noether’s charge as well as the CVH
algebra which encodes this conformal symmetry at the hamiltonian
level.  Then, I will explain how this cosmological system can be
mapped to the well known conformal mechanics developed by de Alfaro,
Fubini and Furlan, and which provides the simplest example of a
classically conformal field theory in 1d. This conformal structure
extends beyond this simple homogeneous and isotropic setting. I will
briefly discuss the inclusion of a cosmological constant,
anisotropies, self-interacting potential for the scalar field, as well
as work in progress on the fully inhomogeneous Einstein-Scalar system.
Finally, I will discuss the consequences of this new conformal
structure at the quantum level. A major outcome is the possibility to
apply the conformal bootstrap program to quantize the theory. Just as
quantum conformal mechanics, I will show that despite the lack of a
conformally invariant group state, it is possible to find an operator
which reproduces the standard form of the CFT two points function in
quantum cosmology. I will discuss the cosmological interpretation of
this operator and the vacuum state which are used to construct this
correlator.  In the end, this provides a first step to bootstrap
quantum cosmology using this new conformal symmetry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 14:00, Chris Belczynski (Copernicus Center, Warsaw, Poland), will be talking about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gravitational-wave-astrophysics-ligovirgo-bh-bhbh-nsns-ns-mergers&quot;&gt;Gravitational-wave Astrophysics: LIGO/Virgo BH-BH/BH-NS/NS-NS mergers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will discuss the astrophysical importance of the recent LIGO/Virgo
direct detections of gravitational-waves. Despite the fact that massive
BH-BH dominance in gravitational-wave signal was predicted prior the
detections, it is not at all clear which one of the several formation
scenarios produces these massive mergers. This inhibits astrophysical
information inference from LIGO/Virgo observations, as conclusions are
different within each formation scenario. There is quite an opposite
problem with the first detection of NS-NS merger in an old elliptical
host galaxy, as none of the formation channels can easily recover
rather high NS-NS merger rate estimated by LIGO/Virgo. The recent
detection of BH-NS merger seems to indicate the existence of compact
objects in the first mass gap.
Additionally, all of the ten O1/O2 LIGO/Virgo BH-BH merger detections
have low values for their effective spins. I will demonstrate how this
can be naturally explained within framework of classical binary evolution
scenario of the formation of BH-BH mergers. It appears that magnetic
fields (Tayler-Spruit dynamo) play an important role in efficient
transport of angular momentum and spin-down of massive stars that produce
low-spinning black holes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a coffee break, at 15:30, Sébastien Clesse (CURL, UCLouvain)
will talk about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;primordial-black-hole-predictions-for-black-hole-merger-detections-in-ligovirgo&quot;&gt;Primordial black hole predictions for black hole merger detections in LIGO/Virgo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soon after the first gravitational-wave detection, it has been
suggested that the black hole merger progenitors might have a
primordial origin, and eventually explain all or part of the Dark
Matter in the Universe.  Due to the known thermal history of the
Universe, the primordial black hole (PBH) mass function have specific
features that will be probed by the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo.
The predictions for the mass distribution of black hole merger
progenitors and their spins are distinguishable from the ones of
stellar evolution scenarios, and the upcoming detections will be
decisive to confirm or rule out the scenario.  In addition to explain
mergers around 30 solar masses, PBH predict a second peak around 2
solar mass, due to the boost of PBH formation at the QCD transition,
and some mergers above 60 solar masses, in the mass gap, with low mass
ratios, and involving one sub-solar black hole.  These features are
universal, whatever is the underlying PBH formation scenario and their
abundance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html">On Thursday 22th, we have the pleasure to host the Belgian Gravitational Waves meeting.
