determining when the wavenumbers of astrophysical interest today
exited the Hubble radius during the inflationary epoch. These instants
are commonly evaluated using the slow-roll approximation and measured
in e-folds time. <a href="/members/auclair"><strong>Pierre</strong></a>,
<a href="/members/blachier"><strong>Baptiste</strong></a> and <a href="/members/chris"><strong>Christophe</strong></a>
propose a new analytical method to determine these instants with a
precision reaching the tenth of an e-fold.</p>

<p>Cosmic Inflation is the leading explanation for the origin of cosmic
structures: these are seeded by quantum fluctuations occurring around
the event horizon of a exponentially fast accelerating space-time, see
this <a href="/news/2022/09/15/2205.12608.html"><strong>post</strong></a>. By measuring
the distribution of galaxies in our universe, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_(spacecraft)"><strong>Euclid</strong></a>
satellite is expected to provide very soon new exquisite measurements of these
fluctuations. Testing cosmic inflation will therefore require to have
exquisite predictions as well.</p>

<p>As aforementioned, observable predictions currently rely on the
slow-roll approximation to determine the so-called e-fold times
\(\Delta N=N−N_\mathrm{end}\), in reference to the e-fold
\(N_\mathrm{end}\) at which inflation ended. These instants are
actually used to map structures in the sky to quantum fluctuations
during inflation. The precision at which they are determined is not so
good, they are typically known at \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) e-fold
precision. The following figure uses a full numerical integration of
various inflationary models to compute the error made (vertical axis)
using the slow-roll approximation as a function of the exact timing
(horizontal axis).</p>

<p>In Ref. <a class="citation" href="#auclair:2024udj">[1]</a>, we propose a new and simple
<strong>velocity correction</strong>, on top of slow-roll, that increases by one
order of magnitude the precision on \(\Delta N\). As
shown in the following figure, when compared to the exact solution,
our new method reaches an precision of about a tenth of e-fold (<strong>blue
curve</strong> compared to the red one).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2406.14152/fooivce.png" alt="vce" /></p>

<p>The other curves (green and purple) show other corrections, improving
the determination of \(\phi_\mathrm{end}\), the field value at which
inflation ends. These ones may, or may not, improve over the velocity
correction, depending on the model at hand.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making observable predictions for cosmic inflation requires determining when the wavenumbers of astrophysical interest today exited the Hubble radius during the inflationary epoch.

an unprecedented Bayesian model comparison in the landscape of nearly
three-hundred models of single-field slow-roll inflation.</p>

<p>In its simplest incarnation, Cosmic Inflation can be realised by a
single field rolling down a potential and hundred of different
theoretical embeddings have been proposed since the advent of the
paradigm. Comparing these models to data could be viewed as Herculean
tasks and we have been sharing these enjoyments with <a href="https://www.iap.fr"><strong>Jérôme
Martin</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/vincent-vennin/?lang=en"><strong>Vincent
Vennin</strong></a> in the
past decade.</p>

<p>In Ref. <a class="citation" href="#martin:2024qnn">[1]</a>, we present the most recent and
strongest contraints on single-field inflation imposed by the lastest
cosmological data, namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)"><strong>Planck
satellite</strong></a> 2020
Cosmic Microwave Background data, the <a href="http://bicepkeck.org/"><strong>BICEP/Keck

Survey</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Our analysis incorporates the most accurate theoretical predictions
for the quantum fluctuations generated during inflation, the so-called
third-order slow-roll spectra for both primordial gravitational waves
and curvature fluctuations (see this <a href="/news/2022/09/15/2205.12608.html"><strong>post</strong></a>). The Bayesian model comparison analysis
uses some machine learning tools implementing the methods developped
in Ref. <a class="citation" href="#ringeval:2013lea">[2]</a> and include all the new models
presented in the <a href="/news/2023/05/08/EI.html"><strong>Opiparous Edition of the Encyclopædia
Inflationaris</strong></a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The following figure shows the one-dimensional marginalised posterior
distributions obtained for the inflationary cosmological parameters,
i.e., when the cosmic structures are seeded by the inflationary
quantum fluctuations.</p>

<p>Notice that the third slow-roll parameter
\(\epsilon_3\) is now constrained in a range perfectly consistent with slow-roll and we find</p>

<p>\(-0.44 &lt; \epsilon_3 &lt; 0.55 \quad (95\%\,\texttt{CL})\).</p>

<p>One may also notice the maximum probability for \(\epsilon_1\) at
non-vanishing values, showing a weak statistical preference for the
presence of primordial gravitational waves in the current data (mostly
driven by the BICEP/Keck data). We have</p>

\[\log(\epsilon_1) &gt; 4.9 \quad (95\%\,\texttt{CL}),\]

<p>with</p>

\[\log(\epsilon_1) &lt; -2.6 \quad (98\%\,\texttt{CL}).\]

<hr />

<p>The Bayes’ factors and maximum likelihood ratios for all models of the
Encyclopædia Inflationaris are:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2404.10647/bestevid.png" alt="bayes" /></p>

<p>The reference model is denoted as “SR3” and represents the pure
slow-roll analysis assuming no specific potential, only the natural
priors for the slow-roll parameters \(\epsilon_i\in[-0.2,0.2]\). Bars
extended to the left mean the models are models, they are favoured
when the bar is extended to the right (with respect to agnostic
slow-roll). The bottom labels give the Jeffreys’ scale of Bayesian
evidence with respect to the best model. We find that \(40\%\) of all
scenarios can be considered ruled-out (strongly disfavoured according
to the Jeffreys’ scale) whereas \(20\%\) of the models are most probable
given the current data.</p>

<hr />

<p>Our approach also allows us to constrain the reheating epoch, the
transition period between cosmic inflation and the hot Big-Bang phase
in which the universe is a relativistic plasma.</p>

<p>The following figures are scattered plots of inflationary models
positionned according to their Bayesian evidence (horizontal axis) and
the information gain on the reheating epoch (vertical axis). The color
scale traces the mean value (over its posterior) of the reheating
parameter \(\ln R_\mathrm{reh}\).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2404.10647/obsreheating_Dklreh_bestonly.png" alt="obsreating" /></p>

<p>Each model is also encircled in a gauge counting the number of
unconstrained model parameters (derived using Bayesian
dimensionality). Non-encircled models are models for which all
parameters are constrained by the data, models with a full circle
around have all their parameters unconstrained (which are then
superfluous to fit the data). As such, the most probable and most
efficient models are those on the right having no circle around.</p>

<p>Weighted over the landscape, we find that the current data constrain
the kinematics of reheating by \(1.3\) bits. The precision reached by
the current cosmological data is such that almost half of the
inflationary landscape is out of the game, but, also, for each of the
favoured models, the way the universe reheated to become a plasma can
now be inferred by astrophysical and cosmological observations. We are
talking here of an epoch of the universe being, at least, at redshift \(z &gt; 10^{10}\)!</p>

In a recent publication, <a href="/members/blachier"><strong>Baptiste</strong></a> and
<a href="/members/auclair"><strong>Pierre</strong></a> tackle the clustering problem of these
enigmatic objects using an excursion-set approach to deal with the
so-called “cloud-in-cloud” mechanism.</p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBH) are cosmological objects that could have
been formed in the earliest instants of the universe’s history, for
instance, when large overdensities collapse under their own gravity.
Understanding how these PBHs cluster is essential as it can provide
insights into the evolution of structure formation in the universe and
could potentially help in assessing how much, and when, binaries of
these objects appear.</p>

<p>In Ref. <a class="citation" href="#auclair:2024jwj">[1]</a>, <a href="/members/auclair"><strong>Pierre</strong></a>
and <a href="/members/blachier"><strong>Baptiste</strong></a> have used the excursion-set
formalism to quantify the initial spatial clustering of PBHs generated
from large Gaussian density fluctuations. Their method takes into
account the “cloud-in-cloud” mechanism, which is a critical aspect
that is overlooked in studies using the Poisson model of clustering.</p>

<p>In the excursion-set formalism, the collapse of an overdensity to form
a PBH of mass \(M\) is recast into the probability of finding the
first crossing of a random walk at some scale \(S(M)\). This approach
has been already applied to study the formation of large-scale
structure, in which multiple crossings of a random walk describe a
hierarchy of structures. This formalism was first developed to solve
the “cloud-in-cloud” problem, that is resolving this hierarchy of
structures.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2402.00600/spread.png" alt="spread" /></p>

<p>The cloud-in-cloud mechanism implies that PBHs should be part of
larger structures: they don’t just appear randomly as per the Poisson
assumption. This results in a natural and intrinsic correlation
between the formation of pairs of PBHs, which is important for
accurately modelling the clustering behaviour at small scales. The
following picture shows two random walks that share a common past
until the “time” \(S_{r}\): they come from the same realisation of a
large scale density perturbation. Subsequently, they evolve in
distinct ways and this results in two different collapses that occur
respectively at the first-crossing times \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2402.00600/duo.png" alt="duo" /></p>

<p>Such an approach automatically includes short-range exclusion effects:
PBHs are anti-correlated at short distances!</p>

<p>The authors also present explicit expressions for the excess
probability to find pairs of PBHs separated by a given distance and
for the excess probability to find pairs with an asymmetric mass
ratio.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chris Ringeval</name></author><category term="News" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are primordial black holes already clustered in the early universe?
